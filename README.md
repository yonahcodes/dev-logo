# dev-logo
This project automates the process of overlaying PNG logo images onto a background PNG image. It includes a Bash script for converting SVG logo files to PNG format (using Inkscape) and a Python script that uses the Pillow library to perform the PNG overlay, allowing for customization of logo placement and sizing.
